    <span><h1>Flourish Wellness Application</h1>
    <h3>Flourish is a wellness app designed for health conscious individuals who are looking for a centralized resource to track and store all their health information to improve their overall diet, fitness, and wellness. This project featured end-to-end design, including competitive analysis, user research, information architecture design, low-high fidelity wireframes & prototypes, usability testing, design documentation including a style guide and pattern library, as well as addressing user accessibility. This was an independent project in which I had the opportunity to immerse myself in the UX design process from start to finish in order to provide a product which solves a user problem. I was able to draw inspiration, conceptualization, iteration, and finally exposition to create Flourish.
